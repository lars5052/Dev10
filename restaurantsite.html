        <p>Restaurant Description</p>
        <p>The Cove is a family-owned restaurant situated in downtown Northland. The eclectic vibe, friendly staff, and out-of-this-world food will please any visitor. We offer locally-sourced products such as the eggs in our Modern Eggcitement dish and the patties that grace our uniquely crafted burgers. Come on in for an early lunch or late dinner, or anytime in between. We offer beverages ranging from beer and wine to chocolate milk and iced tea. Our motto is "Join our space, make it your place." We look forward to meeting you soon! -XOXO The Cove staff</p>
